## Getting Started

### Prerequisites

Before you begin, make sure you have the following installed:

*   [Node.js](https://nodejs.org/)

*   [yarn](https://yarnpkg.com/)

*   [nvm](https://github.com/nvm-sh/nvm/blob/master/README.md#intro)

*   ssh

### Installation

1.  Clone [this repository](https://github.com/emerging-eco/app)

2.  Navigate to the cloned project folder.

3.  To use the correct NodeJS version use: `nvm use`

4.  Install dependencies with a simple terminal command: `yarn`

If you are going to contribute to the Project, install these extensions to your IDE:

1.  ESLint (`dbaeumer.vscode-eslint`)

2.  Prettier (`esbenp.prettier-vscode`)

3.  Prettier ESLint (`rvest.vs-code-prettier-eslint`)

### Configuration

1.  Request Environment variables from somebody (but they are secret).

## Running the App

To run the app locally, use the following command:

```
yarn dev
```

Your app should be available at `http://localhost:3000` (the address should be visible in the terminal).

## Deployment

The app is deployed on [Netlify](https://www.netlify.com/) by [Alwyn](https://github.com/alwyn-ixo) only.

## Folder Structure

First, let's review the folder structure and then go through each folder, explaining it:

```
emerging-eco-app/
â”œâ”€ pages/
â”œâ”€ components/
â”‚  â”œâ”€ containers/
â”‚  â”œâ”€ modals/
â”‚  â”œâ”€ pages/
â”‚  â”œâ”€ presentational/
â”œâ”€ assets/
â”œâ”€ constants/
â”œâ”€ helpers/
â”œâ”€ utils/
â”œâ”€ theme/
â”œâ”€ public/
â”œâ”€ types/
â”œâ”€ hooks/
```

### `ðŸ“„ pages`

This folder is responsible for managing routing, based on [the Next.js framework](https://nextjs.org/docs/pages/building-your-application/routing). This folder should contain less logic and layout.

### `ðŸ“„ components/Pages`

The components in this folder are responsible for rendering the layout of pages and contain components, which will be rendered only on a particular page. So `ðŸ“„ components/Pages/Collections` contain all components that will be rendered only on this page. If a component will be reused, it should be moved to another folder.

### `ðŸ“„ components/Containers`

The components in this folder are responsible for rendering domain-sensitive data. These components use redux a lot.

### `ðŸ“„ components/Modals`

The components in this folder are responsible for rendering elements to the root of the HTML document.

### `ðŸ“„ components/Presentational`

The components in this folder are responsible for rendering NOT domain-sensitive data. For example, the `Chart`<swm-token data-swm-token=":components/Presentational/Chart/index.tsx:22:6:6:`export default function Chart({`"/> can take any data in chart format. Components of this folder do not use redux.

### Other folders

*   `ðŸ“„ assets` - not executable files (like images).

*   `ðŸ“„ types` - domain-sensitive TypeScript types.

*   `ðŸ“„ hooks` - custom React hooks.

*   `ðŸ“„ constants` - sealed variables, sometimes defined by the `.env` variables.

*   `ðŸ“„ helpers` - contains domain-sensitive functions (like data transformations).

*   `ðŸ“„ utils` - contains NOT domain-sensitive functions that work not knowing anything about the domain (like `shortStr`<swm-token data-swm-token=":utils/shortStr.ts:1:6:6:`export default function shortStr(`"/>).

*   `public/` - [according to the framework](https://nextjs.org/docs/getting-started/installation#the-public-folder-optional) this contains files that will be served statically for all pages of the application.

*   `ðŸ“„ requests` - contains async functions requesting anything through the HTTP protocol. All requests to any API should be here.

## API Data

As was written above, all requests through HTTP should be located in the `ðŸ“„ requests` folder.

_BlockSync_ API is the main source of all collections and entities. For now, all requests to Blocksync are done with the `apisause` library and stored in `ðŸ“„ requests/blocksync.ts`.

## End-to-end tests

Usage and how to run explained in [End-to-end tests](end-to-end-tests.rbpiqpfz.sw.md)

## State Management

// TODO: write documentation after refactoring

// FIXME: [EMERGING-168 Refactor Redux](https://ixo.youtrack.cloud/issue/EMERGING-168/Refactor-Redux)

## Code Formatting

This app has the configuration for ESLint and Prettier for consistent code formatting. Install IDE extensions to notice all ESLint errors and avoid warnings. `ðŸ“„ .eslintrc.js`, `ðŸ“„ .prettierrc.json`.

## Version Control

Each change can come to the repo only through a GitHub Pull Request targeted to the `develop` branch.

Each new branch should be named in this format: `TYPE OF A BRANCH` / `TICKET NUMBER` / `short description`.

*   `TYPE OF A BRANCH` - can be `bugfix`, `feature`, `chore`, `docs`, `tests`, `hotfix`, etc...

*   `TICKET NUMBER` - should be taken from [the YouTrack board](https://ixo.youtrack.cloud/agiles/121-20/) (i.e. `e-162`). If no ticket, or it is a `hotfix`, you can write `e-xxx`.

PR prepared for the review should be rebased on the `origin/develop`. Usually, when you have a couple of commits of changes, you can use this approach to actualize your branch.

```powershell
git fetch # check actual state on the origin
git rebase origin/develop # can have a few conflicts, it is ok
git push -f # override the exisitng branch with the same name on the origin. It is ok as well ;D
```

Recommended to use VSCode extention Git Graph (`mhutchie.git-graph`) to see, control, and check git history.

GH PR can have [labels](https://github.com/emerging-eco/app/labels). When you just created it and still working on it set `IN PROGRESS`. Then use `READY FOR REVIEW`, after an approval, please actualise your commit with git rebase and set `READY FOR MERGE`. Use other Labels when appropriate.
