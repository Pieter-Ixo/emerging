The project has end-to-end tests (e2e) configured using the [Playwright](https://playwright.dev). Please read the [Best Practices article from the Playwright docs](https://playwright.dev/docs/best-practices#avoid-testing-third-party-dependencies) before contributing to these tests.

## How to run tests in the app

The Playwright needs an address to test. So we need to start a local server. To build, run, and test the app use these scripts:

<br/>

Use these scripts to develop e2e tests. First, make a fast build (with checks disabled) and start the app with one command: `build-start`<swm-token data-swm-token=":package.json:10:2:4:`    &quot;build-start&quot;: &quot;yarn build:fast &amp;&amp; next start&quot;,`"/>.

Now you are ready to run the project tests. Open a new terminal and run `test`<swm-token data-swm-token=":package.json:11:2:2:`    &quot;test&quot;: &quot;npx playwright test&quot;,`"/>. The Playwright will try to test the app running at [localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) (See doc below to see how the target can be changed).

`testgen`<swm-token data-swm-token=":package.json:13:2:2:`    &quot;testgen&quot;: &quot;build-start &amp; npx playwright codegen localhost:3000/&quot;,`"/> opens [a Test-generator tool from Playwright](https://playwright.dev/docs/codegen-intro) to assist you with creating new tests.

### ðŸ“„ package.json
```json
8          "build:fast": "ENVIRONMENT='localhost-tests' next build",
9          "start": "next start",
10         "build-start": "yarn build:fast && next start",
11         "test": "npx playwright test",
12         "test:start": "build-start & npx playwright test",
13         "testgen": "build-start & npx playwright codegen localhost:3000/",
```

<br/>

For now, the target address for tests is specified in the `ðŸ“„ e2e-tests/constants.ts`

<br/>

This constant is used as a target for e2e tests. In the future, we can use a `.env` variable for this.

```typescript
