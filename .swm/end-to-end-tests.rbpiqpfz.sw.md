Project has end-to-end tests (e2e) configured using [Playwright](https://playwright.dev). Please read [Best Practices article from the Playwright docs](https://playwright.dev/docs/best-practices#avoid-testing-third-party-dependencies) before contributing to these tests.

## How to run tests in the app

Playwright need an adress which will be tested by our tests. So we need to start a local server. Better to make a build and test this build. In order to make and run the build use these scripts:

<br/>

Use these scripts to develop e2e tests. First make a fast build (with checks disabled) and start the app in one command which is `build-start`<swm-token data-swm-token=":package.json:10:2:4:`    &quot;build-start&quot;: &quot;yarn build:fast &amp;&amp; next start&quot;,`"/>. Then you are ready to run tests, just open a new terminal and run `test`<swm-token data-swm-token=":package.json:11:2:2:`    &quot;test&quot;: &quot;npx playwright test&quot;,`"/>. Playwright will try to test the app running at [localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) (See doc below to see how tartget can be changed).

`testgen`<swm-token data-swm-token=":package.json:13:2:2:`    &quot;testgen&quot;: &quot;build-start &amp; npx playwright codegen localhost:3000/&quot;,`"/> will open [a Test-generator tool from Playwright](https://playwright.dev/docs/codegen-intro) which will assist you with creating new tests.

### ðŸ“„ package.json
```json
8          "build:fast": "ENVIRONMENT='localhost-tests' next build",
9          "start": "next start",
10         "build-start": "yarn build:fast && next start",
11         "test": "npx playwright test",
12         "test:start": "build-start & npx playwright test",
13         "testgen": "build-start & npx playwright codegen localhost:3000/",
```

<br/>

For now target address for tests specified in the `ðŸ“„ e2e-tests/constants.ts`

<br/>

This constant is used as a target for e2e tests. In future we can simply use a `.env` variable for this.
<!-- NOTE-swimm-snippet: the lines below link your snippet to Swimm -->
### ðŸ“„ e2e-tests/constants.ts
```typescript
1      export const APP_LOCATION = "http://localhost:3000/";
2      
```
